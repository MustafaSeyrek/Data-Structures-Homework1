# Data-Structures-Homework1
In this assignment, you are expected to implement an Brent's method hashing to index words of a document named as ‘story.txt’. You must read this file, split it word by word, and index each word to your hash table according to rules given below.
RULES
- Usage of Abstract Data Types (ADT) is required. Object Oriented Principles (OOP) and try-
catch exception handling must be used when it is needed. You will use Java.

- Hash code for converting each word to an integer key must be implemented by yourself. The
input value will be the word and the integer key will be returned by your hash code function.
The number of occurrence of each word must be stored as count value.
- The hash (compression) function for converting a key to the index (address calculator) must
be implemented by yourself.
- When a word is searched in the hash table; key, count, and index of the word should be
printed.
